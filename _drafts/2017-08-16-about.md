Welcome to the official website for the Epsilon Iota Chapter of Tau Epsilon Phi! We boast a tight-knit brotherhood at RPI, as well as at our 13 other chapters around the country. We are always welcoming to fellow TEP brothers, no matter where or when they joined.

The chapter house located at 1991 15th Street provides boarding for up to twelve. You can catch us maxing and relaxing on our front balcony, or whipping up some grub in our industrial kitchen which was built just a few years ago.

TEP was founded at Columbia University on October 19, 1910 by ten Jewish men seeking a brotherhood free from exclusion based on race, religion, or creed. The RPI chapter, Epsilon Iota, was first founded in 1957, then re-founded in 1988, after a struggle with low membership suffered by many fraternities in the 1970s. Because of bureaucratic conflicts in the mid-1990s and 2000s, the Epsilon Iota chapter temporarily broke away from the national organization and founded Tau Epsilon Pi on October 19, 2009, dedicated to preserving the customs, traditions, and ideals of the fraternity the chapter loves. Following the removal of a corrupt national officer in 2010, Tau Epsilon Phi is now back on its feet, and on June 1, 2011 the Epsilon Iota chapter rejoined the ranks of our fellow Tau Boys. An extended history and more information on the national fraternity can be found at the [TEP National website](www.tep.org).

For more information on the members, rush, and contact information, be sure to check out the rest of the site and feel free to come by the house any time. TEPS are TOPS!
